# Prepare config for pip (Ubuntu)

Before publishing, you need to create file `~/.pypirc` like this:

    [distutils]
    index-servers=
        pypi
        private_pypi
    
    [pypi]
    repository: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ 
    username: <username_pypi>
    password: <password_pypi>
    
    [private_pypi]
    repository: <private-pypi-registry>
    username: <username_private_pipy_registry>
    password: <password_private_pipy_registry>
    
You must to set this file into home directory. 

# Publish package to private_pypi pypi server

Before publish, set differences into CHANGELOG.md, setup.py version. After that, you need to create new release into master branch on 
github. Now, you need update package:

    python setup.py bdist_wheel upload -r private_pypi
    
This command push your image to pypi-package-registry

# Installing package from private pypi repository

You must lay the config file `pip.conf` into `~/.pip/`:

    [global]
    index-url = http://<login>:<password>@<your-host>:<your-port>
    trusted-host = pypi.python.org
                   pypi.org
                   <your-host>

# Publish image into docker registry (for local development and testing)

Before build, you need add `pip.conf` into `.secrets`. You can see template [here](https://github.com/Hedgehogues/docker-compose-deploy/blob/master/.deploy/.secrets/pip.conf)

From the root directory build the image

    docker-compose -f .deploy/docker-compose.full.yml build
    
After that, you must find the line with next text (last lines):

    Successfully built <image-id>
    Successfully tagged <image-name>:latest
    
Now, you must set tag for image:

    docker tag <image-id> <private-docker-registry>/<project>-<version>-<service-name>:<the-same-version-setup.py>
    
Please, add insecure-registry parameters to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (first time):

    {
        "insecure-registries" : [ "<private-docker-registry-schema>://<private-docker-registry-host>:<private-docker-registry-port>" ]
    }
    
And restart docker (first time):

    sudo service docker restart

Now, login in docker registry with your login and password (first time):

    docker login <private-docker-registry> -u="<username>" -p="<password>"
    
Push the image:

    docker push <private-docker-registry>/<project>-<version>-<service-name>:<the-same-version-setup.py>
    
After that, you need remove image:

    docker rmi <image-id> --force

You can see images:

    http://<private-docker-registry>/v2/_catalog
    
You can see all versions for image:

    http://<private-docker-registry>/v2/<image-name>/tags/list
 
Or concrete versions:

    http://<private-docker-registry>/v2/<image-name>/tags/list
    
If you want remove specific version from pypi-registry, you can do this:

    curl --form ":action=remove_pkg" --form "name=pkg" --form "version=0.0.0" 0.0.0.0:1234 -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-string>"

    
**Notice**: while docker image building, we fix all environment variables includes ports and endpoints. After that, you cannot to change them. We will fix it in the future
