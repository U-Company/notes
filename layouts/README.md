# layouts

We use some layouts (templates) for developing:

## python private service layout

If you want to use this one, you must do this:

    pip install cookiecutter
    cookiecutter https://github.com/U-Company/python-service-layout.git
    cookiecutter python-service-layout

After that, you get consistent service with template for tests, deploying to registries, monitoring and more other 
useful things. You can see this layout [here](https://github.com/U-Company/python-service-layout/blob/master/README.md)
